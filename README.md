# toogle-string

Step 1: Create a singleton object by name Main
Step 2: Create an instance of ToggleString Class
Step 3: Take the input from user by **readLine**
Step 4: Use try and catch method to handle the exception. 
        *If User doesn't enter the String in that case it throw the Exception
        *Else call the method toggleString(input) defined in the ToggleString Class
Step 5: Create a Toggle String Class and inside it create a method with single parameter as String type and method should return string.
Step 6: Inside the toggleString method take a variable of name afterToggleString and assign to empty.
Step 7: Start the for loop from 0 until inputString.length and store the character index to asciiValue variable
Step 8: If asciiValue greater than equal to 65 and less than equal to 90 than change the uppercase to lowercase
Step 9: Else if asciiValue greater than equal to 97 and less than equal to 122 than chnage the lowerCase to upperCase and return the String.
Step 10: In Singleton object print the return string after converting.
